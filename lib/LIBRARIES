# Do not delete this file.
#
# This file lists all the .jar files and native libraries required by this
# version of ArtiSynth, and is used to automatically download and update
# these files from the ArtiSynth file server.
#
# Each library must be listed on a separate line. The character '#' comments
# out all remaining characters to the end of the line. Libraries may be preceded 
# by an optional system-specifier, which describes the type of operating system
# forwhich the library is required. Libraries without a system specifier are
# assumed to be required on all systems. The system specifier must match the
# name of one of the enumerated types defined by NativeLibraryManager.SystemType,
# located in maspack.fileutil.
#
# Names ending in .jar are assumed to be jar files. Other names are assumed to
# indicate native libraries. Jar files are typically required on all systems,
# but in some cases there are system-specific jar files that contain native
# libraries; this is the case for the JOGL2.
#
# Native library names can contain a suffix of the form (.n)+, where n
# is a non-negative integer, which gives version number
# information. If version information is present, the first number is
# the major version number, the second number (if present) is the
# minor version number, and other numbers indicate revision
# numbers. When checking for native libraries, it is assumed that a
# library with the indicated base name plus major version number must
# be present on the system. Other version numbers are allowed to
# differ as long as the minor version number is greater than or equal
# to the one specified in this file.
#
# Native library names are transformed into system-specific names
# appropriate for the current native system. For instance,
# TetgenJNI.1.0 gets transformed into libTetgenJNI.so.1.0 on Linux and
# TetgenJNI.1.0.dll on Windows.
#
# Native libraries can also be specified using a system-specific
# specfic format; e.g., libgomp.so.1 (Linux). If this is done, the
# indicated library is sought only if the indicated system matches the
# current native system. This allows different libraries to be
# specified for different systems.
