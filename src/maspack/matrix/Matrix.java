/**
 * General interface for matrices. It specifies methods which allow one to set
 * and get various matrix components (e.g., individual elements, rows, columns,
 * submatrics), and do various non-modifying queries such as finding out its
 * size, computing it's determinant, or comparing it with other matrices. There
 * is also a method {@link #setSize setSize} for resizing, which can be used
 * unless the matrix size is fixed (which can be determined using {@link
 * #isFixedSize isFixedSize}).
 * 
 * <p>
 * This interface does not support operations such as multiplication or
 * addition. The reason for this is that specific implementations may have a
 * specialized structure which could be compromised by arbitrary operations. For
 * instance, if an implementing class represents orthogonal matrices, then it
 * does not make sense for that class to allow an <code>add</code> operation.
 * Similarly, for an implementation representing symmetric matrices, any
 * muliplication methods should not be open to general matrices.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Of course, it is possible to corrupt any special implementation structure
 * using the <code>set</code> methods provided in this base class, but it was
 * felt that not including such routines would be overly restrictive. It is
 * therefore up to the user to safeguard implementation integrity against misuse
 * of the <code>set</code> methods.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that indices for matrix elements, rows, and columns are zero-based. The
 * range of valid indices for a matrix of size m X n is
 * {@code [0, ... , m-1]} and {@code [0, ... , n-1]}.
