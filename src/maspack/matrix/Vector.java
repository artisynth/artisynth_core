/**
 * General interface for vectors. It provides methods for setting and getting
 * the elements of a vector, and to do various non-modifying queries such as
 * finding out its size, computing it's norms, or comparing it with other
 * vectors. There is also a method {@link #setSize setSize} for resizing, which
 * can be used unless the vector size is fixed (which can be determined using
 * {@link #isFixedSize isFixedSize}).
 * 
 * <p>
 * This base class does not publicly support vector operations such as addition
 * or scaling. The reason for this is that specific implementations may have a
 * specialized structure which could be compromised by arbitrary operations. For
 * instance, an implementation that represents only unit vectors, should not
 * allow an <code>add</code> operation.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Of course, it is possible to corrupt any special implementation structure
 * using the <code>set</code> methods provided in this base class, but it was
 * felt that not including such routines would be overly restrictive. It is
 * therefore up to the user to safeguard implementation integrity against misuse
 * of the <code>set</code> methods.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that indices for vector elements are zero-based, so that the range of
 * valid indices for a vector of length n is <code>[0, ... , n-1]</code>.
